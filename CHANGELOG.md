---

## [2.2.1] - 2026-01-02

### Restored Lead Agent Visibility

This patch restores the visibility of the **5 Lead Agents** in the Claude Code agent picker and improves their discoverability via slash commands. While especialistas remain internal to keep the picker clean, Leads are now directly accessible again.

### Changed

- **Lead Agent Discovery**: Moved 5 Lead Agents (`ai-ml-lead.md`, `data-lead.md`, etc.) from `internal/` to the root of `.claude/agents/`.
- **Directory Structure**: Renamed the `internal/` specialist folder to `specialists/` for better clarity.
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Updated `AGENTS.md`, `ROLE-REGISTRY.md`, and all `README.md` files to reflect the v2.2.x hierarchical architecture.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Updated generated instructions to match the current **Brainstorm → Plan → Implement** workflow.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-02

### Intelligent Orchestrator with Brainstorm → Plan → Implement Workflow

This release introduces a completely redesigned **single Orchestrator agent** that thinks strategically before acting. Instead of showing 30+ agents, users now have one intelligent coordinator that dynamically selects the right skills for each project.

### Changed

#### Agent Architecture Redesign

| Before                      | After                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 31 agents visible in picker | **1 agent** → Orchestrator                           |
| Immediate execution         | **3-phase workflow**: Brainstorm → Plan → Implement  |
| All skills loaded           | **Lazy loading** from registries (95% token savings) |

#### New Orchestrator Workflow

**Phase 1: Brainstorm**

- Deep understanding of the request
- Identifies constraints, risks, and opportunities
- Considers alternative approaches
- Asks clarifying questions if needed

**Phase 2: Plan**

- Scans SKILL-REGISTRY.md and ROLE-REGISTRY.md
- Selects ONLY the roles/skills needed (typically 3-7)
- Defines clear milestones and deliverables
- Presents plan for user approval

**Phase 3: Implement**

- Executes step by step, loading skills as needed
- Validates each step before proceeding
- Adapts plan if blockers arise
- Synthesizes results and documents learnings

### Structure

```
.claude/agents/
 orchestrator-agent.md  ← ONLY visible agent
 SKILL-REGISTRY.md      ← Lightweight skill index (~200 lines)
 ROLE-REGISTRY.md       ← Lightweight role index (~150 lines)
 internal/              ← 30 specialist agents (loaded on demand)
     ai-ml-lead.md
     security-lead.md
     ai-engineer-agent.md
     ... (30 files)
```

### Added

- **Brainstorming phase** with approach options comparison
- **Implementation plan template** with milestones and dependencies
- **Adaptive planning** when blockers arise
- **Validation checkpoints** after each milestone
- **Mandatory rules** for security, quality gates, and cost awareness

### Removed

- Specialist agents from Claude Code agent picker (moved to `internal/`)
- Complex multi-agent invocation syntax
- Redundant agent frontmatter (consolidated into Orchestrator)

### Migration

No action required. The Orchestrator automatically selects and uses the specialist agents internally.

**Before:**

```
@ai-engineer-agent: Execute ai-02 (RAG Pipeline)
@security-architect-agent: Execute sa-01 (PII Detection)
```

**After:**

```
@Orchestrator "Build a RAG chatbot"

# Orchestrator automatically:
# 1. Brainstorms requirements
# 2. Creates plan with ai-02, ai-04, sa-01, etc.
# 3. Implements step by step
```

## [2.1.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- **Critical: Installation now copies agents and skill-docs directories**
  - Fixed `cli.js` to copy `agents/` directory (76 agent definition files)
  - Fixed `cli.js` to copy `skill-docs/` directory (42 documentation files)
  - Fixed `cli.js` to copy configuration files (`settings.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `skills-index.md`, `README.md`)
  - Previously these were declared in `package.json` files array but not actually copied during installation

### Changed

- Updated installation summary to show agents and skill-docs counts
- Improved role count display (now shows "26+ specialized role directories")

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-02

### Changed

- Version bump to 2.1.0

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-02

### BREAKING CHANGE: Agentic Architecture - 93% Token Reduction

This major release completely redesigns the skill loading architecture to reduce session startup from **~70k tokens to ~5-6k tokens** (93% reduction) while maintaining access to all 200+ skills.

### The Problem (v1.x)

Previous versions loaded all skill files at session start, consuming significant context window:

- ~50 agent/skill files loaded upfront
- ~70,000 tokens consumed before any work began
- Limited context remaining for actual tasks

### The Solution (v2.0)

New **on-demand loading architecture**:

- Only orchestrator + skills index loaded at startup (~5-6k tokens)
- Skills loaded dynamically when needed
- Code templates externalized to separate files

### Added

#### Core Architecture Files

- **skills/orchestrator.md** - Single entry point with ANALYZE→SELECT→LOAD→EXECUTE workflow
- **skills-index.md** - Compact keyword-based index of all 200+ skills (~3-4k tokens)
- **skill-docs/** - 40 role skill files loaded on-demand (~500 tokens each)

#### Externalized Templates

- **templates/compliance/** - checker.py, policies.yml, workflow.yml
- **templates/dashboard/** - grafana.json, alerts.yml, generator.py

### Changed

#### Massive File Reduction

| Category          | Before    | After    | Reduction |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
| Agent definitions | 25 files  | 0 files  | -100%     |
| Command files     | 40+ files | 1 file   | -97%      |
| Skill files       | Inline    | External | -88% avg  |
| **Total lines**   | ~25,000   | ~2,500   | **-90%**  |

#### Specific Files

- `compliance-automation.md`: 748 → 80 lines (89% reduction)
- `enterprise-dashboard.md`: 614 → 75 lines (88% reduction)
- `orchestrator.md`: Consolidated from 600+ lines across multiple files

### Removed

- `.claude/agents/` - All 25 individual agent definitions
- `.claude/agents/leads/` - 5 lead agent files
- `.claude/agents/specialists/` - 24 specialist agent files
- `.claude/commands/*.md` - 40+ heavyweight command files
- `.claude/AGENTS.md` - Replaced by skills-index.md
- `.claude/QUICKSTART.md` - Replaced by README.md
- `.claude/settings.json` - No longer needed

### How It Works

```
Session Start (~5-6k tokens)
 skills/orchestrator.md     # Core workflow
 skills-index.md            # Compact skill lookup

On-Demand (when skill invoked)
 skill-docs/{role}.md       # Skill guidance
 templates/{category}/      # Code examples
```

**Workflow:**

1. **ANALYZE** - Orchestrator identifies domain, complexity, compliance needs
2. **SELECT** - Matches keywords to skills from compact index
3. **LOAD** - Reads full skill files only when executing
4. **EXECUTE** - Applies guidance, references templates

### Migration from v1.x

No action required. The new architecture is backward compatible:

- Same `/orchestrator` command works
- All 200+ skills still available
- Skills load transparently when needed

### Usage

```bash
# Install/update
npx tech-skills install

# Use orchestrator (recommended)
/orchestrator "Build a customer churn prediction model"

# Direct role commands still work
/ai-engineer "Create a RAG pipeline"
/security-architect "Review for PII"
```
