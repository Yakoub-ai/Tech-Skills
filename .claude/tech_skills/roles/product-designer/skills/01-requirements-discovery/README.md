  problem_statement_template: |
    ## Problem Statement

    **Who**: [Target user segment]
    **What**: [The problem they face]
    **When**: [Context/situation when it occurs]
    **Why it matters**: [Business and user impact]
    **Current solutions**: [How they solve it today]
    **Gap**: [What's missing]

  validation_questions:
    - "Is this a real problem or assumed?"
    - "How do users solve this today?"
    - "What's the cost of not solving this?"
    - "How many users are affected?"
    - "Is this problem getting worse?"
```

### 2. Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

```yaml
jtbd_framework:
  job_statement_format: |
    When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]

  example: |
    When I'm preparing for a client meeting, I want to quickly find
    relevant case studies, so I can demonstrate our expertise and
    win the deal.

  job_dimensions:
    functional: "What task needs to be accomplished?"
    emotional: "How do they want to feel?"
    social: "How do they want to be perceived?"

  forces_of_progress:
    push: "Pain with current solution"
    pull: "Attraction of new solution"
    anxiety: "Fear of change"
    habit: "Comfort with current solution"
```

### 4. Feature Prioritization

```yaml
prioritization_frameworks:
  moscow:
    must_have: "Critical for launch, non-negotiable"
    should_have: "Important but not critical"
    could_have: "Nice to have if time permits"
    wont_have: "Explicitly excluded from this release"

  rice_scoring:
    formula: "(Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort"
    reach: "Number of users affected per quarter"
    impact: "0.25 (minimal) to 3 (massive)"
    confidence: "0.5 (low) to 1.0 (high)"
    effort: "Person-months required"

    example:
      feature: "One-click checkout"
      reach: 10000  # users/quarter
      impact: 2     # high
      confidence: 0.8
      effort: 2     # person-months
      score: "(10000 × 2 × 0.8) / 2 = 8000"

  kano_model:
    basic: "Expected features - absence causes dissatisfaction"
    performance: "More is better - linear satisfaction"
    excitement: "Unexpected delighters - high satisfaction"
    indifferent: "No impact on satisfaction"
    reverse: "Presence causes dissatisfaction"

  weighted_scoring:
    criteria:
      - name: "User Value"
        weight: 0.35
      - name: "Business Value"
        weight: 0.25
      - name: "Technical Feasibility"

      - name: "Strategic Alignment"
        weight: 0.20
```

    example: "Weekly Active Users who complete a task"

  okr_structure:
    objective: "Qualitative goal"
    key_results:
      - "Measurable outcome 1"
      - "Measurable outcome 2"

  pirate_metrics_aarrr:
    acquisition: "How do users find us?"
    activation: "Do users have a great first experience?"
    retention: "Do users come back?"
    referral: "Do users tell others?"
    revenue: "Do users pay?"

  metric_types:
    leading: "Predict future outcomes (signups, engagement)"

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the problem, not the solution**
2. **Validate assumptions with user research**
3. **Write clear, testable acceptance criteria**
4. **Prioritize ruthlessly using data**
5. **Document decisions for future reference**
6. **Keep requirements living documents**
7. **Involve engineering early**
8. **Define success metrics before building**
