```
Raw Data → Feature Engineering → Feature Store → Training/Serving
                ↓                       ↓              ↓
         Transformations          Versioning     Low-latency
         Validation              Lineage        Online/Offline

```

##  Quick Start

    name="customer_features",
    backend="azure_ml"  # or "feast", "tecton"
)

# Define feature transformations
engineer = FeatureEngineering()

# Create feature group
features = engineer.create_features(
    source_table="bronze.customer_events",
    transformations=[
        engineer.aggregate("purchases", window="30d", agg=["sum", "count", "mean"]),
        engineer.categorical_encode("customer_segment"),
        engineer.time_features("last_activity_date"),
        engineer.ratio("purchase_amount", "page_views")
    ]
)

# Register in feature store
store.register_features(
    feature_group="customer_behavior",
    features=features,
    version="v1",
    description="Customer behavior features for churn prediction"
)

# Get features for training
training_data = store.get_historical_features(
    feature_refs=["customer_behavior:v1"],
    entity_df=training_entities,
    point_in_time="event_timestamp"
)

# Get features for online serving
online_features = store.get_online_features(
    feature_refs=["customer_behavior:v1"],
    entity_keys={"customer_id": "12345"}
)
```

cost_tracker = FeatureCostTracker()

@cost_tracker.track_feature_cost
def compute_features_incremental(last_processed_timestamp):
    """Compute only new features since last run (saves 80-95% compute costs)"""

    # Read only new data
    new_data = spark.read.parquet("bronze.events") \
        .filter(f"event_timestamp > '{last_processed_timestamp}'")

    # Incremental aggregations
    new_features = new_data.groupBy("customer_id").agg(
