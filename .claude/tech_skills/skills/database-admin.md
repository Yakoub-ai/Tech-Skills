## When to Use DBA Skills

- Optimizing slow database queries
- Designing index strategies
- Planning backup and recovery procedures
- Scaling databases with replication/sharding
- Database performance tuning
- Managing schema migrations
- Resolving transaction and locking issues

## Integration with Other Roles

**Always coordinate with:**

- **Backend Developer (be-04)**: Schema design and query optimization
- **Data Engineer (de-01, de-05)**: Data pipelines and performance
- **SRE (sr-01, sr-07)**: Incident response and disaster recovery
- **Security Architect (sa-04, sa-06)**: Access control and encryption
- **DevOps (do-03)**: Infrastructure as code for databases
- **FinOps (fo-05, fo-06)**: Storage and compute optimization

## Best Practices

1. **Regular EXPLAIN Analysis** - Profile queries in production-like environments
2. **Index Maintenance** - Regular index rebuild and statistics updates
3. **Backup Testing** - Regularly test restore procedures
4. **Connection Pooling** - Use PgBouncer/ProxySQL for connection management
5. **Monitoring** - Track slow queries, locks, replication lag
6. **Migration Safety** - Always test migrations on staging first
7. **Isolation Levels** - Use READ COMMITTED by default, escalate as needed
8. **Partition Pruning** - Design partitions for query patterns

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each skill is in `.claude/roles/database-admin/skills/{skill-id}/README.md`

Each README includes:

- SQL optimization examples
- Configuration templates
- Monitoring queries
- Recovery procedures
- Performance benchmarks

## Quick Start

To use a DBA skill:

1. Start with db-01 (Query Optimization) for performance issues
2. Add db-02 (Index Strategies) for systematic improvement
3. Use db-03 (Backup & Recovery) for data protection
4. Implement db-05 (Performance Tuning) for server optimization
5. Apply db-06 (Migrations) for schema changes

For comprehensive project planning, use the **orchestrator** skill first.
