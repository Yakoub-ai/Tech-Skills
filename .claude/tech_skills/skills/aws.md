## When to Use AWS Architect Skills

- Designing AWS cloud architectures
- Implementing serverless applications
- Setting up container orchestration
- Optimizing AWS costs
- Configuring networking and security
- Deploying infrastructure as code

## Integration with Other Roles

**Always coordinate with:**

- **GCP (gcp-\*)**: Multi-cloud strategies
- **Azure (az-\*)**: Hybrid cloud deployments
- **Network Engineer (ne-01, ne-06)**: Network security and design
- **Security Architect (sa-03, sa-04)**: Cloud security
- **FinOps (fo-04, fo-05, fo-12)**: AWS cost optimization
- **DevOps (do-03, do-04)**: IaC and GitOps

## Best Practices

1. **Well-Architected** - Follow AWS Well-Architected Framework
2. **Least Privilege** - Minimal IAM permissions
3. **Multi-AZ** - Deploy across availability zones
4. **Tag Everything** - Consistent tagging for cost tracking
5. **Encryption** - Encrypt data at rest and in transit
6. **Spot for Batch** - Use Spot Instances for interruptible workloads
7. **CloudFormation/CDK** - Infrastructure as code always
8. **Cost Monitoring** - Set budget alerts early

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each skill is in `.claude/roles/aws/skills/{skill-id}/README.md`

Each README includes:

- Architecture patterns
- CloudFormation/CDK examples
- Security configurations
- Cost optimization tips
- Best practices

## Quick Start

To use an AWS Architect skill:

1. Start with aws-06 (VPC) for network foundation
2. Add aws-07 (IAM) for security
3. Use aws-01/aws-02 for compute (EC2 or Lambda)
4. Implement aws-04/aws-05 for data layer
5. Optimize with aws-12 (Cost Optimization)

For comprehensive project planning, use the **orchestrator** skill first.
