## When to Use DevOps Skills

**ALWAYS use for production:**
- **do-01** (CI/CD) - Automated deployment pipeline
- **do-08** (Monitoring) - Observability and alerting

**Use for infrastructure:**
- **do-03** (IaC) - Terraform/Bicep for all cloud resources
- **do-02** (Containers) - Containerize applications
- **do-04** (GitOps) - Infrastructure version control

**Use for quality:**
- **do-06** (Testing) - Automated test suites
- **do-07** (Release) - Safe deployment strategies
- **do-09** (DevSecOps) - Security in CI/CD

## Integration with Other Roles

**DevOps enables:**
- **AI Engineer**: Deploy LLM apps with do-01, monitor with do-08
- **ML Engineer**: Deploy models with do-01, container with do-02
- **Data Engineer**: IaC for pipelines with do-03, monitor with do-08
- **Security Architect**: DevSecOps with do-09, scan IaC with sa-03
- **FinOps**: Track deployment costs with fo-01

## Best Practices

1. **CI/CD for Everything** - Automate deployments with do-01
2. **Infrastructure as Code** - All infrastructure in Terraform/Bicep (do-03)
3. **Containerization** - Package apps in Docker (do-02)
4. **Multi-Environment** - Dev, Staging, Production (do-05)
5. **Automated Testing** - Tests in CI/CD (do-06)
6. **Blue-Green Deployments** - Zero-downtime releases (do-07)
7. **Comprehensive Monitoring** - Metrics, logs, traces (do-08)
8. **Security Scanning** - SAST/DAST in pipeline (do-09)
9. **GitOps** - Git as source of truth (do-04)

## CI/CD Pipeline Template

```yaml
# Standard pipeline stages
stages:
  1. Build & Test
     - Checkout code
     - Install dependencies
     - Run unit tests (do-06)
     - Security scan (do-09)
     - Build artifacts/containers

  2. Security & Quality
     - SAST scanning (do-09, sa-05)
     - Dependency scanning
     - IaC validation (sa-03)
     - Cost validation (fo-01)

  3. Deploy to Staging
     - Deploy infrastructure (do-03)
     - Deploy application (do-01)
     - Integration tests (do-06)
     - Smoke tests

  4. Deploy to Production
     - Approval gate
     - Blue-green deployment (do-07)
     - Canary rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
     - Monitor (do-08)
     - Rollback if needed
```

## Monitoring Stack

Use do-08 to implement:
- **Metrics**: Prometheus/Azure Monitor
- **Logs**: Application Insights/Log Analytics
- **Traces**: OpenTelemetry
- **Dashboards**: Grafana/Azure Dashboards
- **Alerts**: PagerDuty/Azure Alerts

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each skill is in `.claude/roles/devops/skills/{skill-id}/README.md`

Each README includes:
- Pipeline templates
- Terraform/Bicep examples
- Kubernetes manifests
- Monitoring configurations
- Quick wins

## Quick Start

DevOps implementation workflow:
1. **Start with do-03** - Define infrastructure as code
2. Add **do-01** - Create CI/CD pipeline
3. Include **do-06** - Automated testing
4. Implement **do-08** - Monitoring and alerting
5. Add **do-09** - Security scanning
6. Use **do-07** - Safe deployment strategies

For comprehensive DevOps planning, use the **orchestrator** skill first.
