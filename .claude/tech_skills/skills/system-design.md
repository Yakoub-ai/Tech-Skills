## Additional Resources

- **Disaster Recovery Playbook**: Comprehensive DR procedures
- **Enterprise Integration Patterns**: API Gateway, Event-Driven, Saga patterns
- **AI Governance Framework**: Ethics, risk management, model cards

## When to Use System Design Skills

- Designing new systems from scratch
- Migrating from monolith to microservices
- Improving system reliability
- Reducing infrastructure costs
- Building cloud-native applications
- API design and integration

## Integration with Other Roles

**Always coordinate with:**

- **Security Architect (sa-03, sa-05)**: Infrastructure and application security
- **DevOps (do-01, do-02, do-03)**: CI/CD, IaC, container orchestration
- **Platform Engineer (pe-01, pe-02)**: Internal developer platform
- **Data Engineer (de-01)**: Data architecture alignment
- **FinOps (fo-01, fo-05, fo-07)**: Cost-aware design decisions

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with monolith, evolve to microservices
2. **Design for Failure** - Assume everything will fail
3. **Measure First** - Understand current performance before optimizing
4. **Automate Everything** - Infrastructure as Code for reproducibility
5. **Document Decisions** - Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
6. **Security by Design** - Integrate security from the start
7. **Cost Awareness** - Consider cost implications in design choices
8. **SLO-Driven** - Define SLOs before building

## Documentation

Detailed documentation:

- `system-design/best-practices.md`: Comprehensive design guide
- `system-design/disaster-recovery-playbook.md`: DR procedures
- `system-design/enterprise-integration-patterns.md`: Integration patterns
- `system-design/ai-governance-framework.md`: AI governance
- `system-design/walkthroughs/`: Step-by-step guides

## Quick Start

To use a System Design skill:

1. Reference the appropriate documentation
2. Gather requirements (functional and non-functional)
3. Create architecture diagrams (C4 model)
4. Document trade-offs and decisions
5. Validate with stakeholders

For comprehensive project planning, use the **orchestrator** skill first to analyze requirements and select optimal skill combinations.
