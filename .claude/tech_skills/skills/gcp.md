## When to Use GCP Architect Skills

- Designing GCP cloud architectures
- Implementing data warehousing (BigQuery)
- Setting up GKE for containers
- Optimizing GCP costs
- Configuring network security
- Deploying serverless applications

## Integration with Other Roles

**Always coordinate with:**

- **AWS (aws-\*)**: Multi-cloud strategies
- **Azure (az-\*)**: Hybrid cloud deployments
- **Data Engineer (de-01, de-04, de-05)**: BigQuery and data pipelines
- **Network Engineer (ne-01, ne-06)**: Network design and security
- **Security Architect (sa-03, sa-04)**: Cloud security
- **FinOps (fo-04, fo-12)**: GCP cost optimization

## Best Practices

1. **Defense in Depth** - VPC Service Controls + IAM + encryption
2. **Least Privilege** - Minimal service account permissions
3. **Regional Resources** - Deploy in multiple zones
4. **Tag Resources** - Labels for cost tracking
5. **BigQuery Partitioning** - Partition for cost and performance
6. **Preemptible VMs** - 80% savings for batch workloads
7. **IaC** - Terraform or Deployment Manager
8. **Budget Alerts** - Set alerts at 50%, 80%, 100%

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each skill is in `.claude/roles/gcp/skills/{skill-id}/README.md`

Each README includes:

- Architecture patterns
- Terraform/gcloud examples
- Security configurations
- Cost optimization tips
- Best practices

## Quick Start

To use a GCP Architect skill:

1. Start with gcp-06 (VPC) for network foundation
2. Add gcp-07 (IAM) for security
3. Use gcp-01/gcp-02 for compute
4. Implement gcp-04/gcp-05 for data layer
5. Optimize with gcp-12 (Cost Management)

For comprehensive project planning, use the **orchestrator** skill first.
