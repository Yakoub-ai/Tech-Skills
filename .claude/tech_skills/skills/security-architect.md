   - Encrypted configuration management
   - Certificate lifecycle

7. **sa-07: Security Monitoring & Incident Response**
   - Azure Sentinel integration
   - Anomaly detection
   - Incident playbooks
   - Security dashboards

## When to Use Security Architect Skills

- Handling PII or sensitive data (ALWAYS use sa-01 first)
- Securing infrastructure and applications
- Implementing IAM and access control
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Security monitoring and incident response
- Secrets management
- Threat modeling for new systems

## CRITICAL Security Rules

**MANDATORY for these scenarios:**

1. **PII/Personal Data** → Use sa-01 FIRST
   - Customer data, employee data, any personal information
   - Scan at data ingestion (Bronze layer for Data Engineer)
   - Mask before RAG indexing (AI Engineer)
   - Remove before model training (ML Engineer)

2. **Production Systems** → Use sa-02 (Threat Modeling)
   - Identify attack vectors before deployment
   - Generate security requirements
   - Document mitigations

3. **Cloud Infrastructure** → Use sa-03 (IaC Security)
   - Validate Terraform/Bicep templates
   - Scan for security misconfigurations
   - Enforce security baselines

4. **Secrets/Credentials** → Use sa-06 (Secrets Management)
   - Never hard-code secrets
   - Use Azure Key Vault
   - Implement rotation

## Integration with Other Roles

**Security is FIRST for:**
- **Data Engineer**: sa-01 at Bronze layer, before any processing
- **AI Engineer**: sa-01 before RAG indexing, ai-04 for LLM safety
- **ML Engineer**: sa-01 to remove PII from training data
- **Data Scientist**: sa-01 for masking in analysis/reports
- **DevOps**: sa-05 in CI/CD, sa-03 for IaC scanning
- **All Roles**: sa-06 for secrets, sa-07 for monitoring

## Best Practices

1. **PII Detection** - Scan BEFORE processing (Bronze layer, before indexing, before training)
2. **Least Privilege** - Grant minimum necessary permissions
3. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple security layers
4. **Zero Trust** - Never trust, always verify
5. **Encryption** - At rest and in transit
6. **Audit Logging** - Track all security-relevant events
7. **Secrets Rotation** - Automate with sa-06
8. **Security Monitoring** - Real-time alerts with sa-07

## Cost Optimization for Security

- **Sampling for PII scans** - Scan samples of large datasets
- **Cache PII detection results** - Reuse for unchanged data
- **Right-size compliance compute** - Use appropriate instance sizes
- Reference fo-01 for cost tracking

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each skill is in `.claude/roles/security-architect/skills/{skill-id}/README.md`

Each README includes:
- Tools and implementation scripts
- Integration with data/AI/ML pipelines
- Compliance automation
- Azure security services
- CI/CD security gates
- Quick wins

## Quick Start

Security-first approach:
1. **Start with sa-01** if ANY PII/sensitive data
2. Add **sa-02** for threat modeling
3. Use **sa-06** for all secrets
4. Implement **sa-03** for infrastructure
5. Enable **sa-07** for monitoring
6. Integrate **sa-05** in CI/CD

For comprehensive security planning, use the **orchestrator** skill first.
