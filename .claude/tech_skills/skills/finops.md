## Critical Cost Optimizations

### AI/ML Cost Savings (70-90%)

1. **Prompt Caching** - 90% LLM cost reduction
   - Reference: ai-01 (Prompt Engineering)
   - Cache system prompts and tool descriptions
   - Use for agents and RAG systems

2. **Spot Instances for Training** - 60-90% training cost savings
   - Reference: ml-01 (MLOps Pipeline), ml-03 (Training)
   - Implement checkpointing
   - Use for non-time-critical training

3. **Embedding Cost Optimization** - 60-70% savings
   - Reference: ai-02 (RAG), ai-05 (Vector Embeddings)
   - Cache embeddings
   - Batch API calls
   - Choose appropriate embedding models

4. **Storage Lifecycle Policies** - 40-60% storage savings
   - Reference: de-01 (Lakehouse)
   - Hot (30 days) → Warm (90 days) → Cold (365 days)
   - Automated archival

5. **Auto-scaling** - 30-50% compute savings
   - Reference: ml-04 (Model Serving)
   - Scale down during low usage
   - Use serverless where appropriate

### Data Pipeline Cost Savings (40-70%)

1. **Storage Tiering** - 50% storage cost reduction
   - Bronze/Silver/Gold layer optimization
   - Archive old data automatically

2. **Right-sized Compute** - 30-40% compute savings
   - Use appropriate Spark cluster sizes
   - Implement auto-termination

3. **Incremental Processing** - 20-40% savings
   - Process only new/changed data
   - Avoid full scans

## When to Use FinOps Skills

**ALWAYS use fo-01 (Cost Visibility) for:**
- Any project with cloud resources
- AI/ML applications (high cost)
- Data pipelines
- Production deployments

**Use fo-07 (AI/ML Cost Optimization) for:**
- LLM applications (prompt caching → 90% savings)
- Model training (spot instances → 80% savings)
- Vector databases (embedding optimization)
- RAG systems

**Use fo-05 (Spot Optimization) for:**
- ML model training
- Batch processing
- Non-time-critical workloads

**Use fo-06 (Storage Tiering) for:**
- Lakehouse architectures
- Large data volumes
- Long-term data retention

## Integration with Other Roles

**Cost tracking for:**
- **AI Engineer**: fo-07 for LLM costs, embedding costs, vector DB costs
- **ML Engineer**: fo-07 for training/serving costs, fo-05 for spot instances
- **Data Engineer**: fo-05 for storage lifecycle, fo-06 for compute optimization
- **DevOps**: fo-06 for infrastructure right-sizing
- **All Roles**: fo-01 for visibility

## Best Practices

1. **Track Everything** - Use fo-01 from day one
2. **Set Budgets** - Use fo-03 with alerts at 80% threshold
3. **Tag Resources** - Use fo-02 for cost attribution
4. **Optimize AI/ML First** - Biggest cost savings potential (70-90%)
5. **Implement Lifecycle Policies** - fo-05 for 40-60% storage savings
6. **Use Spot Instances** - fo-05 for 60-90% training cost reduction
7. **Right-size Continuously** - fo-06 based on actual usage
8. **Enable Chargeback** - fo-08 for cost accountability

## Quick Start

Cost optimization workflow:
1. **Start with fo-01** - Enable cost visibility
2. Add **fo-03** - Set budgets and alerts
3. Implement **fo-07** - AI/ML cost optimization (if applicable)
4. Use **fo-05** - Spot instances for training
5. Configure **fo-06** - Storage lifecycle policies
6. Enable **fo-08** - Chargeback reporting

For comprehensive cost planning, use the **orchestrator** skill first.
