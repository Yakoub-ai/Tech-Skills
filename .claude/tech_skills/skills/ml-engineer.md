## When to Use ML Engineer Skills

- Building MLOps pipelines
- Training and deploying ML models
- Implementing feature stores
- Model serving at scale
- Monitoring ML models in production
- Distributed training for large models
- Model optimization and compression

## Integration with Other Roles

**Always coordinate with:**
- **Data Engineer (de-01, de-02, de-03)**: Feature pipelines and data quality
- **Data Scientist (ds-01, ds-03, ds-04)**: Model prototypes and features
- **MLOps (mo-01, mo-03, mo-06)**: Experiment tracking, registry, monitoring
- **FinOps (fo-01, fo-07)**: Training/serving cost optimization (60-90% savings)
- **DevOps (do-01, do-02, do-08)**: CI/CD, containers, monitoring
- **Security Architect (sa-01)**: PII removal from training data

## Best Practices

1. **Spot Instances for Training** - 60-90% cost savings with ml-01 + fo-07
2. **Auto-scaling Inference** - 40% savings with ml-04 + fo-06
3. **Experiment Tracking** - Track all experiments with mo-01
4. **Model Registry** - Version all models with mo-03
5. **Monitor Drift** - Detect data/model drift with ml-05, mo-06
6. **PII Removal** - Scan training data with sa-01
7. **CI/CD for Models** - Automate with do-01
8. **Feature Store** - Use ml-02 for consistent features
9. **A/B Testing** - Deploy with ml-04 for gradual rollout

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each skill is in `.claude/roles/ml-engineer/skills/{skill-id}/README.md`

Each README includes:
- Tools and implementation scripts
- Cost optimization strategies
- Security best practices
- Azure ML integration
- Deployment pipelines
- Quick wins

## Quick Start

To use an ML Engineer skill:
1. Start with ml-01 (MLOps Pipeline) for foundation
2. Add ml-02 (Feature Store) for feature management
3. Use ml-03 (Training) with spot instances for cost savings
4. Deploy with ml-04 (Serving) and auto-scaling
5. Monitor with ml-05 (Drift Detection)
6. Track everything with mo-01, mo-03, mo-06

For comprehensive project planning, use the **orchestrator** skill first.
