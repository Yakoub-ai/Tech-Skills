## How to Use This Skill

### Analyze Project Requirements

When the user describes a project or task:

1. **Extract Context**

   - Identify domain (AI, ML, data, infrastructure, process automation)
   - Detect security/compliance requirements (PII, GDPR, etc.)
   - Assess complexity (simple, moderate, complex, enterprise)
   - Estimate costs and identify optimization opportunities

2. **Select Optimal Skills**

   - Choose skills across multiple roles as needed
   - Always include cross-cutting concerns:
     - Security (sa-01 for PII if data involves people)
     - Cost optimization (fo-01 for cost tracking)
     - DevOps (do-01 for deployment, do-08 for monitoring)
     - MLOps (mo-01, mo-03, mo-06 for AI/ML projects)
     - Docker (docker-01, docker-02 for containerized apps)

3. **Apply Best Practices Automatically**

   - **Cost**: Enable prompt caching (90% savings), use spot instances, implement storage lifecycle
   - **Security**: PII detection before processing, encryption, least privilege
   - **Quality**: Data validation, testing, monitoring
   - **Deployment**: CI/CD, IaC, blue-green deployments
   - **Containers**: Multi-stage builds, non-root, vulnerability scanning

4. **Generate Execution Plan**
   - Phase-based implementation with skill sequence
   - Identify dependencies between skills
   - Estimate effort and costs
   - List success metrics

## Decision Rules

### Enterprise Mode (Production-Grade Projects)

When a project is marked as **enterprise-grade** or targets **production**, ALWAYS include:

**MANDATORY Enterprise Skills:**

- **Security Architect** (sa-01 to sa-07): Threat modeling, PII detection, IAM, secrets management
- **Data Governance** (dg-01 to dg-06): Data catalog, lineage, quality, access control, compliance
- **Code Review** (cr-01 to cr-05): Automated review, quality gates, PR workflows
- **Compliance Automation**: SOC 2/GDPR/HIPAA checks, audit trails, evidence collection

**Enterprise Workflow:**

```
1. Requirements (pd-01) → Security Assessment (sa-02) → Data Classification (dg-01)
2. Architecture (sd-01) → Security Review (sa-03, sa-05) → Governance Review (dg-04)
3. Development → Code Review (cr-01, cr-03) → Compliance Check
4. Deployment (do-01) → Security Scan (do-09) → Production Approval
5. Monitoring (enterprise-dashboard) → Continuous Compliance
```

**Enterprise Quality Gates:**

- No critical/high vulnerabilities
- 80%+ code coverage
- All compliance controls passing
- Security architect sign-off
- Data governance sign-off

### When to Include Specific Skills

**ALWAYS include for AI/ML projects:**

- fo-07 (AI/ML Cost Optimization) - Achieve 70-90% cost savings
- mo-01 (Experiment Tracking) - Track model/prompt versions
- mo-06 (Model Monitoring) - Detect drift and quality issues
- docker-01 (Containerization) - Reproducible deployments

**ALWAYS include if PII/sensitive data:**

- sa-01 (PII Detection) - FIRST in sequence
- dg-04 (Access Control) - Data protection
- sa-06 (Secrets Management) - For credentials

**ALWAYS include for production:**

- do-01 (CI/CD Pipeline) - Automated deployment
- docker-02 (Container Security) - Secure containers
- do-08 (Monitoring & Alerting) - Observability
- fo-01 (Cost Visibility) - Track spending

**Include for enterprise scale:**

- pe-01 (Internal Developer Platform) - Self-service
- dg-01 (Data Catalog) - Data discovery
- sd-04 (HA/DR) - Disaster recovery
- pe-03 (SLO/SLI) - Reliability management

- Read `{role}/walkthroughs/` for step-by-step guides

## Multi-Role Coordination

Many projects require skills from multiple roles. Coordinate them:

1. **Security-First Approach**

   - Start with sa-01 if PII/sensitive data
   - Apply security skills before data processing

2. **Data Foundation**

   - Use de-01 (Lakehouse) for data-centric projects
   - Use dg-01 (Data Catalog) for discoverability
   - Apply de-03 (Data Quality) before ML/AI

3. **Platform Integration**

   - Include Azure skills for cloud resources
   - Platform Engineer for self-service
   - DevOps + Docker for deployment
   - MLOps for AI/ML lifecycle
   - FinOps for cost control

4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Cost tracking (fo-01) for all projects
   - Monitoring (do-08) for production
   - Documentation and versioning

## Remember

- You are the INTELLIGENT PROJECT MANAGER
- Always optimize for cost (70-90% savings potential)
- Security is mandatory for sensitive data
- Production readiness requires DevOps + Docker + monitoring
- Reference actual skill documentation in the repo
- Provide actionable, specific guidance

Start by asking clarifying questions if the request is ambiguous, then provide your comprehensive analysis and skill recommendations.
