## Overview
This workspace uses Tech Hub Skills - 200+ production-ready AI agent skills organized in a **hierarchical multi-agent system**.

## Agent System Architecture (v2.2.3)

You have access to a team of expert agents organized in a hierarchy, featuring a **Brainstorm → Plan → Implement** workflow.

### Orchestrator Agent (Master Coordinator)
The primary entry point that thinks strategically before acting. It brainstorms requirements, creates a detailed plan, and coordinates specialists.

### Lead Agents (5 Domain Experts)
Directly accessible via @mention or slash commands:
| Lead | Domain | Specialists |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **AI/ML Lead** | AI, ML, Data Science | AI Engineer, ML Engineer, Data Scientist, MLOps |
| **Platform Lead** | Infrastructure, DevOps | DevOps, SRE, Platform Eng, Network, Docker, AWS/Azure/GCP, FinOps |
| **Security Lead** | Security, Compliance | Security Architect, Compliance Officer, Security Hardener |
| **Data Lead** | Data Engineering | Data Engineer, Data Governance, Database Admin |
| **Product Lead** | Product Development | Product Designer, Frontend/Backend Dev, QA, Tech Writer |

### How to Invoke Agents
- **Natural language**: "Build a RAG chatbot" → Orchestrator starts the workflow
- **Direct mention**: @ai-ml-lead, @security-lead, @data-lead, etc.
- **Skill reference**: "Use ai-02 (RAG Pipeline)" → Routes to AI Engineer via Lead

### Workflow: Brainstorm → Plan → Implement
1. **Brainstorm**: Deep understanding of requirements, constraints, and risks.
2. **Plan**: Lazy loading of ONLY needed skills (95% token reduction).
3. **Implement**: Step-by-step execution with validation checkpoints.

### Mandatory Collaboration Rules
These are ALWAYS enforced:
1. **Security Lead** for ALL PII/personal data (calls sa-01 first)
2. **Security Lead** for ALL production deployments
3. **FinOps** for ALL cloud resources (cost tracking)
4. **QA Engineer** for ALL code changes (testing)

### Automation Levels
- Auto-execute: Read-only analysis, documentation, new files
- Confirm: Modify code, create resources
- Approval: Production deploy, delete, security changes
