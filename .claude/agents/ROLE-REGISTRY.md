# Role Registry - Lightweight Index

**Purpose**: Agents reference this compact index to understand all roles. Load FULL role docs ONLY when needed.

## How This Works

```yaml
1. Agent receives task
2. Scan this INDEX for relevant roles
3. Identify which specialists to involve
4. Load ONLY those role files when delegating
5. Unload after task complete
```

## Loading Protocol

```yaml
when_task_arrives:
  step_1:
    action: "Match keywords to roles in this index"
    tokens: ~100

  step_2:
    action: "Identify needed roles"
    example: "'Build RAG chatbot' → AI Engineer, Security Architect"

  step_3:
    action: "Route to appropriate Lead"
    example: "@ai-ml-lead, @security-lead"

  step_4:
    action: "Lead loads EXPERT GUIDANCE"
    example: "read_file('.claude/skill-docs/ai-engineer.md')"

  step_5:
    action: "Lead loads IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS"
    example: "read_file('.claude/roles/ai-engineer/skills/02-rag-pipeline/README.md')"

  step_5:
    action: "Execute task with specialist"

  step_6:
    action: "Unload files, report results"
```

## Cross-Domain Collaboration

Some tasks require multiple domains. Use this matrix:

| If Task Involves  | Always Include                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Personal data     | @security-lead (sa-01)         |
| Production deploy | @platform-lead (do-01)         |
| Cloud resources   | @finops-engineer-agent (fo-01) |
| Data processing   | @data-lead (de-02, dg-02)      |
| API changes       | @qa-engineer-agent (qa-03)     |

## Example: Lazy Loading in Action

```yaml
task: "Deploy ML model to production"

step_1_index_scan:
  keywords: ["ML", "model", "deploy", "production"]
  matched_roles:
    - ML Engineer (model)
    - MLOps (deployment)
    - DevOps (production deploy)
    - Security (production = mandatory)
  tokens_used: 100

step_2_route:
  primary: @ai-ml-lead
  supporting: @platform-lead, @security-lead

step_3_load_skills:
  - Load ml-engineer.md (ml-04 section only) → 200 tokens
  - Load mlops.md (mo-05 section only) → 150 tokens
  - Load devops.md (do-01 section only) → 150 tokens
  - Load security-architect.md (sa-02 section only) → 100 tokens
  TOTAL: 600 tokens

step_4_execute:
  - Apply skills to complete deployment

step_5_unload:
  - Clear skill files from context
  - Report completion

result:
  task_complete: true
  tokens_for_skills: 600 (vs 30,000+ if all loaded)
  quality: Expert-level for the 4 relevant skills
```
